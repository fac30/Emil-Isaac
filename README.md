# Dynamic Web Application Project

This repository contains the code for a dynamic web application built using Node.js, Express, and integration with external APIs. The application queries at least two APIs and presents useful and/or interesting information to the user.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a web application that serves a static web page and dynamically updates it with data fetched from external APIs. The application utilizes Node.js and Express for server-side development and client-side JavaScript for dynamic content rendering.

### Core Features

- Server-Side Setup: Initialize a Node.js project using Express and serve a static web page.
- Static Web Page: Create an index.html file with placeholders for dynamic content.
- JSON Endpoints: Implement routes in Express to fetch data from external APIs and return it in JSON format.
- Dynamic Content: Use client-side JavaScript to make requests to server-side endpoints and update the web page with fetched data.
- Client-Server Interaction: Ensure smooth interaction between the client and server for data fetching and processing.

### Stretch Goals

- Error Handling and Testing: Implement error handling in both server-side and client-side code and write tests for robustness.
- UI Enhancement: Improve user interface aesthetics and interactivity using CSS and interactive elements.
- Additional Client-Side Interactivity: Introduce features such as user inputs for data filtering or customization.
- Documentation and Security: Document the application's functionality and ensure secure storage of sensitive information.
